# Carmageddon 2 Trainer

A Frida-based runtime trainer for Carmageddon 2 (Steam build, `CARMA2_HW.EXE`).
Hooks the live game and calls its internal cheat dispatcher directly — no key
simulation, no save-file editing, no game-file modification.

## What it does

- **Auto-start race** — skips menus, drops you straight into a race
- **Fire any cheat** — all 94 cheat strings are known. Every powerup effect
  is documented (0 unknowns remaining).
- **48 hidden dev cheats** — discovered via static analysis +
  autonomous Frida probing. Includes instant repair, damage cycler (god mode),
  credit ops (+/- 2k/5k or set arbitrary), teleport, gravity toggle, timer
  freeze, HUD/MiniMap toggles, spectator camera, lock-on targeting, checkpoint
  finder, upgrade purchases, camera mode unlock (9 modes including Ped Cam
  and Drone Cam), powerup spawner, and more. See "Dev cheats" tab.
- **No minimize on alt-tab** — game stays visible when you switch windows
- **Windowed-mode toggle** — Ctrl+Shift+W global hotkey, in-bar button, or auto-on-spawn checkbox
- **Pinnable favorites** — right-click any powerup to pin it to the Race tab
- **Friendly status text** — bottom of window shows "In Main menu" / "In race" etc.
- **Disabled-when-detached** — buttons grey out when the game isn't attached
- **Advanced/Developer mode** — opt-in toggle to expose the full cheat table + live debug state
- **Auto-detects game path** — searches Steam registry, running processes, common install paths
- **Bundles nGlide 2.60** — auto-installs the correct version for windowed mode support

## Run

```
py -3 trainer.py
```

Requires Python 3.10+, `frida`, `PySide6`. The game must be the Steam build
(`CARMA2_HW.EXE`, 2,680,320 bytes).

For debug logs, run from a terminal — important lifecycle events go to stderr.

**Safe mode** (disables all hooks, only snap/RPC): `py -3 trainer.py --safe`

**Global hotkey:** `Ctrl+Shift+W` toggles nGlide windowed/fullscreen mode at any
time, regardless of which window has focus.

## Tabs

- **Race**
  - **RACE FLOW**: Auto-start race · Finish race · Enable cheat mode
  - **SPECIAL CHEATS**: Fly mode · Gonad of death (non-powerup actions)
  - **FAVORITES**: dynamic group of user-pinned powerups. Right-click any powerup in the Powerups tab to pin/unpin.
- **Dev cheats** — 48 hidden developer features dispatched by setting `cheat_mode = 0xa11ee75d` and calling polled-table functions directly. Groups: dev mode toggle · player actions · credits ops · powerups spawner · movement · opponents cycler · spectator camera · HUD/display · sound · misc · experimental. Live state for credits, damage state, gravity, HUD mode, spectator state. **Enable Dev Mode first** or nothing else fires.
- **Powerups** — grid of all 89 spawn-powerup cheats with search filter. Right-click for the pin/unpin context menu. Pinned powerups get a Carma-red border.
- **Status** — connection state, force-reattach, About text, and an **Advanced / developer mode** toggle.
- **All cheats** *(only visible in Advanced mode)* — full 94-entry table view with handler/arg columns.

The top bar holds: connection state · Attach/Spawn · Detach · "Start in windowed" checkbox · "Windowed ⇄" runtime toggle button.

## How it works under the hood

1. Frida attaches to `carma2_hw.exe` (or spawns it).
2. The agent installs an `Interceptor.attach` on `GetCheatInputHash` (`0x482f10`).
3. When the trainer fires a cheat, it arms a one-shot override: the next call to
   `GetCheatInputHash` returns our chosen `(h1, h2)` instead of the typed buffer.
4. The game's `CheatDetect` (`0x443c90`) sees a match against its 94-entry table at
   `0x590970` and dispatches the matching handler — exactly as if the user had
   typed the cheat string.

For menu navigation, the agent reimplements the click handler natively using
`NativeFunction` calls into the engine's `menu_cleanup`/`init`/`finalize`/`postfx`
chain — no `SendInput`, no fake mouse cursor.

To stop the game minimizing on alt-tab, the agent hooks `RegisterClass[Ex]A/W`
at startup, captures the game's `lpfnWndProc`, and `Interceptor.attach`es it.
On every WndProc call it inspects the message; deactivation messages
(`WM_ACTIVATEAPP`, `WM_ACTIVATE`, `WM_NCACTIVATE`, `WM_KILLFOCUS`) get rewritten
to `WM_NULL` so the game never triggers its display-mode tear-down.

For the windowed-mode toggle, the agent captures nGlide's `WH_KEYBOARD` hook
proc address (installed via `SetWindowsHookExA` from `glide2x.dll`) and
disassembles it to extract the two memory addresses nGlide flips to request a
mode switch (`TOGGLE_PENDING` and `TOGGLE_FLAG`). At toggle time the trainer
just writes those addresses directly.

## Adding new cheats

When new cheat strings get reverse-engineered, just add them to
`carma2_tools/hash_function.py:KNOWN_CHEATS`. The trainer picks them up
automatically — `cheat_db.py` joins on `(h1, h2)`.

## Persistent settings

Stored via `QSettings('carma2_tools', 'trainer')` (Windows registry):
- `geometry` — window position/size
- `advanced` — Advanced/Developer mode toggle
- `favorites` — list of pinned cheat names
- `game_exe` — auto-detected game path

## Adding a new dev cheat

1. Add the function VA to `agent.js` `DEV` constants block
2. Add an RPC export in `agent.js` `rpc.exports`
3. Add a thin Python wrapper in `frida_core.py` (one liner via `_rpc()`)
4. Add an `Action(...)` row to `dev_actions.py`
5. Restart the trainer — the DevTab picks it up automatically (no UI code)
